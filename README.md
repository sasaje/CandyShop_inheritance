# CandyShop inventory

In this project I have made a candy shop inventory or stock management system.

You can add new products to the stock and load it to products.txt. 
Also you could make changes to the stock and load it from the system's memory. 


It introduces the use of class inheritance (extends) and interfaces (implements). 

The keypoints to this project are: Inheritance, Polymorphism and Exceptions.
